\section{The Simple Population Dynamics Model}
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        \dot v &= v(r-ax) = f_1(v,x), \\
        \dot x &= -bx + cv = f_2(v,x)
    \end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $v$ is the viral strain and $x$ is the specific immune response to the strain. $r$ is the rate at which the virus reproduces. $a$ is the rate at which the immune cells destroy the virus. $b$ is the rate at which the immune cells die off. $c$ is rate at which the immune cells reproduce. This is dependent on the number of viruses present, $v$.  
\subsection{Getting our eigenvalues}
First we take the Jacobian
\begin{equation}
    J =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        r-ax    & -av \\
        c       & -b
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Then we find the characteristic equations by evaluating the Jacobian at the two fixed points of our system $(0,0)$ and $(\alpha,\beta)$, where $\alpha = \frac{br}{ac} $ and let $\beta = \frac{r}{a} $
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
        &J|_{(0,0)} - \lambda I = \lambda^2 + \lambda(b-r) -br = 0\\
        &\implies \lambda_{1,2} = r,-b\\
        &J|_{(\alpha,\beta)}  - \lambda I =  \lambda^2 + \lambda \gamma + \delta\\ 
        &\implies \lambda_{1,2} = \frac{-\gamma \pm \sqrt{\gamma^2 - 4\delta}}{2} \\
        \text{where} \\
        &\gamma =  b - r + a\beta \text{, and } \delta = ac\alpha + ab\beta -rb
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
\subsection{modeling our sytem}
We will now model our system of equations with conditions $r = 2.4, a = 2, b = 0.1, \text{ and }c = 1.$. We will also assume that we are starting with no viruses and no immune response.

\subsubsection{Determining Stability of Fixed points}
The fixed point $(0,0)$ coresponds to the eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = 2.4, \lambda_2 = -.1$, which implies that $(0,0)$ is a saddle point. The fixed point $(\alpha,\beta) = (.12,1.2)$ results in eigenvalues $\lambda_1 = -.05 + 4.873i , \lambda_2 = -.05 - 4873i$, which implies that the point $(.12,1.2)$ is a spiral sink.
